# RSD2 Specification

This project builds on the work of the original RSD 1.0 specification and aims for a broader range of use-cases for service discovery.

The RSD2 Project aims for backward compatibility with the original specification while allowing more data formats using the same information model.

The RSD2 Project started from the need of having a lightweight and flexible service discovery for a wide range of web-services.
